# LayoutLMv2 for Invoice Parsing

This repository demonstrates how to fine-tune [LayoutLMv2](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/layoutlm) for token classification tasks using the FUNSD dataset, with a focus on document understanding and invoice parsing. The code is based on a learning exercise conducted in 2021.

## Before and After: Invoice Parsing Example

Below is a visual example of how LayoutLMv2 processes an invoice:

### Original Invoice Sample

![Original Invoice](input_image.png)

### Parsed Output (Detected Table/Fields)

![Parsed Output](output_image.png)

*The first image shows the raw invoice. The second image shows the output after parsing, with detected tables and fields highlighted.*

## What is LayoutLM?

[LayoutLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13318) is a transformer-based model developed by Microsoft for Document AI tasks. Unlike traditional NLP models, LayoutLM incorporates not only textual information but also the spatial layout and visual features of documents. This is achieved by embedding both the text and the bounding box coordinates of each token, allowing the model to understand the structure and relationships within documents such as forms, invoices, and receipts.

### How LayoutLM Works

- **Text Embeddings:** Standard word embeddings from the document text.
- **Layout Embeddings:** Each token is associated with a bounding box (x0, y0, x1, y1) normalized to the document size, representing its position.
- **Visual Embeddings:** In LayoutLMv2, visual features are extracted from the document image using a CNN backbone and fused with text and layout embeddings.
- **Multi-modal Fusion:** The model combines these three modalities, enabling it to capture both semantic and structural information.

This multi-modal approach allows LayoutLM to excel at tasks where understanding the spatial arrangement of text is crucial, such as key-value extraction, table detection, and form understanding.

## Invoice Parsing with LayoutLM

Invoices are semi-structured documents containing fields like invoice number, date, total amount, and line items. Parsing invoices requires not only recognizing the text but also understanding its position and context within the document.

**LayoutLM can be used for invoice parsing by:**
- **Token Classification:** Identifying and labeling tokens as specific fields (e.g., "Invoice Number", "Total Amount").
- **Key-Value Extraction:** Associating field labels with their corresponding values.
- **Table Detection:** Recognizing and extracting tabular data such as line items.

By fine-tuning LayoutLM on annotated invoice datasets, the model learns to generalize and extract relevant information from unseen invoices.

## Fine-tuning LayoutLM for Invoice Parsing

1. **Dataset Preparation:**  
   Annotate invoices with bounding boxes and labels for each field. The FUNSD dataset is used as an example in this repository.

2. **Preprocessing:**  
   Use `LayoutLMv2Processor` to convert images, words, bounding boxes, and labels into model inputs.

3. **Model Training:**  
   Fine-tune `LayoutLMv2ForTokenClassification` using the processed dataset. The model learns to classify each token into predefined categories.

4. **Evaluation:**  
   Assess the model's performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.

5. **Inference:**  
   Apply the trained model to new invoices to extract structured information.

## Improving Invoice Parsing with Latest AI Advancements

Since 2021, Document AI has seen significant progress:

- **LayoutLMv3:**  
  Improved architecture with better multi-modal fusion and support for more languages.

- **Donut (Document Understanding Transformer):**  
  End-to-end models that directly generate structured outputs from document images without OCR.

- **Pix2Struct:**  
  Vision-language models that understand document layouts and generate structured representations.

- **Large Multimodal Models (LMMs):**  
  Models like GPT-4V and Gemini can process document images and answer questions or extract information with minimal fine-tuning.

**How to make this project better:**
- Use LayoutLMv3 or Donut for improved accuracy and end-to-end extraction.
- Leverage synthetic data generation for robust training.
- Integrate active learning to efficiently annotate new invoices.
- Apply post-processing rules or graph-based models for better key-value association.
- Explore zero-shot or few-shot extraction using LMMs.
